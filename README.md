# SwiftMetalOSXHelloTriangle

This is simply Hello Triangle in Swift, using Metal for OSX.

Apple's examples for Metal appear to be mostly in Obj-C and the Swift metal examples, 
I have otherwise found online are mostly for iOS or a bit more of a mouthful. So, this is 
the smallest program that I managed to write that only draws a single triangle. 

The program relies on MetalKit.
